## Privacy Policy

*Last modified: November 11, 2017*


This privacy policy was created to explain how **Collateral ("the application")** collects, uses and protects information you provide during your use. Such information is used to provide, maintain and personalize certain features to improve your user experience. This privacy policy may be updated or modified at any time without prior notice. Please review this privacy policy periodically and especially before you provide any information.


### How Collateral collects and uses your information


*Information You Provide*

**Identity:** The application may [access your profile information](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/manage-users#get_the_currently_signed-in_user) after signing in with your Google account. Such information is used to determine if you are signed in and if so, to [display the appropiate profile information](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/manage-users#get_a_users_profile).

**Contacts:** The application may access contact information of a contact you specify. Such information is used to create a notification with an action that performs a certain task. For example, you can create a notification with an action that initiates a phone call to a specific contact.

**Storage:** The application may access an image you specify stored on your device. Such information is used to create optimized versions of the image to load and display within the app and/or a notification, if created. Such images are stored locally on your device, in the standard directory in which pictures are placed, for use by the app for the purposes set forth above. If you are signed in with your Google account, such images may be uploaded to your Google Drive's [App Folder](https://developers.google.com/drive/android/appfolder), a special folder that is only accessible by the application and uses your Drive storage quota.

**Location:** The application may, with your consent, access your location to accurately determine sunrise and sunset times for [night mode](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/AppCompatDelegate.html#MODE_NIGHT_AUTO). The application will not share your location with any third parties other than advertising networks which use the location to [serve location-based ads](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6373176) to you. If you do not want the application to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for the application located in your deviceâ€™s settings.

**Children:** The application does not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under age 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any personal information through the app. If you have reason to believe that the application may have accidentally received personal information from an individual under age 13, please send an email to gpvargas3@gmail.com.


*Information Collected Automatically*

[**Analytics**](https://firebase.google.com): The application may collect information or use analytics tools to, among other things, help measure traffic, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain features, and to understand how the application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage.

[**Advertising**](https://google.com/admob): The application may work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the application. These third parties may use technologies to collect such information to deliver advertising targeted to your interests.


### How Collateral protects your information


The application is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of the information you provide. Physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards are used to protect the information you provide that is processed and maintained. Please be aware that the application cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide or guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, modified, altered or destroyed. Alternatively, you can stop all collection of information by uninstalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace.
